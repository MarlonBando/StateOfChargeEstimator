# StateOfChargeEstimator
The algorithm presented here offers a simple yet effective way to estimate the remaining battery percentage of a Formula Student car during an Endurance event. By using the Simulink model contained in the .slx files, the algorithm calculates the weighted average of the power delivered and regenerated over the last 120 seconds (approximately 2 laps). This data is then projected onto the distance still to be traveled, allowing us to estimate how much energy we would have consumed by the end of the Endurance event if we maintained the same race pace.

The output of the algorithm is presented as a percentage of the initial battery charge. This information can be used to inform the race pace and can be integrated into an automatic derating strategy. Furthermore, it can be used as a telemetry output to provide information to the team outside the car, allowing them to make informed decisions on how to proceed during the race. Overall, this algorithm offers a valuable tool for monitoring and optimizing the energy consumption of a Formula Student car during an Endurance event.
